# Using a multi-omic approach to unveil microbial degradation of components in oxidixed low-density polyethylene
Plastics are widely used materials, but their chemical stability hinders biodegradation, exacerbating pollution at a global scale. Plastic-degrading organisms and their enzymes offer promising avenues for the development of biotechnological recycling strategies. Soils contaminated with plastic may foster microbes adapted to degrade plastics or plastic derivatives. Here, two microbial communities originating from soil collected at a plastic-contaminated landfill in Norway were enriched to select for bacteria involved in the decomposition of a commonly used commercial polyethylene (PE; average Mw~4000, average Mn~1700). Metagenomic analysis of the enrichments revealed the high relative abundance of Acinetobacter guillouiae (57.8%) or Pseudomonas sp. (32.7%). Metatranscriptomics identified a suite of upregulated genes (alkane 1-monooxygenase, flavin-containing monooxygenase, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) with functions compatible with degradation of oxidized products and hydrocarbons. Characterization of the commercial PE using spectroscopic, spectrometric and chromatographic methods revealed the presence of low Mw alkanes and 2-ketones. Isolation of A.  guillouiae FS11, followed by proteomic analyses revealed the activation of alkane degradation pathway, and high abundance of several FMOs. Additional spectroscopic analyses and gas chromatography demonstrated utilization of alkanes and ketones in the PELW following growth of A. guillouiae FS11. Our study sheds light on enzymatic mechanisms for degradation of PE-derivatives in soil-associated microbial systems, while offering valuable insights for developing strategies to harness soil microbes and their enzymes for biotechnological applications towards biodegradation of PE-derivatives and oxidized compounds.
