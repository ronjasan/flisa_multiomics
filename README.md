# Mechanistic and analytical insights rethink microbial degradation of a common commercial polyethylene 
Plastics are widely used materials, yet their chemical stability hinders biodegradation, exacerbating pollution on a global scale. Soils contaminated with plastic may foster microbes adapted to degrade plastics or plastic derivatives, and these organisms and their enzymes offer promising avenues for the development of biotechnological recycling strategies. Here, two microbial communities originating from soil collected at a plastic-contaminated landfill in Norway were enriched to select for bacteria involved in the decomposition of a commonly used, model polyethylene (PE; average Mw ~4000, average Mn ~1700). We leveraged genome-resolved metatranscriptomics to identify active population affiliated with Acinetobacter guillouiae and Pseudomonas sp., showing a suite of upregulated genes (including alkane 1-monooxygenase, flavin-containing monooxygenase FMOs, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) with functions compatible with degradation of oxidized products and hydrocarbons.  Strikingly, spectroscopic, spectrometric and chromatographic analyses revealed the unexpected presence of low Mw alkanes and 2-ketones in the commercial substrate, preventing the erroneous conclusion that the community was interacting with the polymeric backbone. Alkanes and 2-ketones with chain length of 10-36 were selectively degraded by an A.  guillouiae isolate, as confirmed by proteomics analyses and substrate characterization following bacterial growth. Besides extending the knowledge on the enzymatic basis for degradation of PE-derivatives in soil-associated microbial systems, our results provide an advanced compositional characterization of a common commercially available “PE” material, while offering valuable insight to support future studies aimed at unequivocally identifying organisms and their enzymes implicated in PE transformation.
